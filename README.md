# Wizard Blast

Expanding on the ["Your first 2D game" tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html) for [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

The goal would be for me to create some sprites and gain some skills, before moving on to the next game, where I would leverage things we learn here!

## Implemented "Extra things"

I am using Godot 4 Alpha, so the implementation is slightly different to what the tutorial suggested in places; I'm the discrepancies will be removed as it moves on to stable!

But I've also implemented a couple extra features:

- Slow Mo
- Particles on Game Over
